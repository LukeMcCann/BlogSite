Advanced Web Module

Laravel - CRUD Application with search capability

This is my first ever CRUD application and the first time I have used php for anything more than short scripts. 
I created this during 2018/19 and put months into developing my web skills from scratch as this was the first
web module I had undertaken. 

The project is built to run on an Ubuntu1604 server. Newer version of npm do not function properly with the application
henceforth the CSS is all inline as it was not possible to fix in order to be able to compile the SCSS in the time I had.
